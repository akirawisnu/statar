\title{Join two data.tables together (similar to Stata command joinby)}
\usage{
ejoin(DTm, DTu, type = m:m, keep = c(c("master", "matched", "using")),
  gen = "_merge")
}
\arguments{
\item{DTm}{The master data.table}

\item{DTu}{The using data.table}

\item{type}{m:m many to many (all pairwise combinations), 1:1 one to one merge, m:1 many to one merge, 1:m one to many. Specifies 1 at the rhs or lhs checks that indeed variables uniquely identify observations.}

\item{keep}{A character vector that specifies rows to keep}

\item{gen}{Name of new variable to mark result, or the boolean FALSE if no such variable should be created. The variable equals 1 for rows in master only, 2 for rows in using only, 3 for matched rows.}
}
\value{
A data.table that joins rows in master and using datases. Matching is done on common names. The data.table master and using are sorted in place.
}
\description{

\examples{
# the option keep specifies rows to keep
 ## inner join
 ejoin(DTm, DTu, keep = "matched", gen = FALSE)
 ## left join
 ejoin(DTm, DTu, keep = c("master","matched"), gen = FALSE)
 ## full outer join
 ejoin(DTm, DTu, keep = c("master","matched","using"), gen = FALSE)
  # the option type specifies whether datasets have duplicates with respect to matching variables
 ejoin(DTm, DTu, type = 1:1)
 ejoin(DTm, DTu, m:1)
