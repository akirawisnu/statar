Description: statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets. statar
    includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join
    datasets with an SQL-syntax, and to manipulate datasets with a panel
    structure (elapsed dates, lead/lag, fill rows for missing dates, fill in
    missing values). statar is based on the data.table package and is inspired
    by Stata.
