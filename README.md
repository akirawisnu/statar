statar
======

A set of R commands for data analysis built on data.table, dplyr and ggplot2.

You can install 
- The latest released version from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statar/index.html) with
````R
install.packages("statar")
````
-  The current version from [github](https://github.com/matthieugomez/statar) with  
````R
devtools::install_github("matthieugomez/statar")
````


Additionally, I have written a  [package vignette](vignettes/main.Rmd), and a [companion guide to R for Stata users](http://www.princeton.edu/~mattg/statar/)
