statar
======

statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets. statar
    includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join
    datasets with an SQL-syntax, and to manipulate datasets with a panel
    structure. statar is based on the data.table package and is inspired by Stata.
