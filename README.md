statar
======

statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets in R if you're used to Stata. The package includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join datasets with `1:m/m:1` check and a `_merge` variable,  to manipulate datasets with a panel structure, and a `stat` for `ggplot2` that matches `binscatter`.

Vignettes present [data.frame functions](vignettes/data.frame.Rmd), [panel data functions](vignettes/panel-data.Rmd), [graph functions](vignettes/graph.Rmd) , and [vector functions](vignettes/vector.Rmd].

You can install 

- The latest released version from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statar/index.html) with

	```R
	install.packages("statar")
	```
-  The current version from [github](https://github.com/matthieugomez/statar) with
