statar
======

statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets. The package includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join datasets with an SQL-syntax, and to manipulate datasets with a panel
structure. statar is based on the data.table package and is inspired by Stata.

The first vignettes presents [the summary functions](vignettes/summary.md), the second presents [the panel data functions](vignettes/panel-data.rmd), the third presents [string and expression interpolation](vignettes/macros.rmd).
